# smbuilder

Remember how cool smlinux was? ***It's now time to bring it back (kinda).***

## What is smbuilder?
In short, smbuilder (stylized as all lowercase) is your swiss-army-knife rust crate that provides an interface for the compilation, management and modification of various ports within the family of ports of Super Mario 64 to the PC.

It aims to support:
 * An interface for compiling the PC ports (running the C compiler, configuring options, etc.)
 * DynOS Datapacks (for ports that support it such as sm64ex-coop and Render96ex)
 * Applying mods and add-ons (patches, texture packs, etc.)
 * Scripts to be ran post-build
 * A build spec in yaml for reproducible builds
